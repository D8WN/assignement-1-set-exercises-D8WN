                         I'm Dawna Xylvia Pinzon and I will be sharing a family favourite cuisine.
                        In my country, we love tropical desserts from multiple neighbouring countries.<br>
                         For now, we are introducing a delicious desert from Thailand. Mango & Sticky Rice is a
                         popular Thai dessert that has its origins in traditional Thai cuisine. The dish is made 
                         with glutinous rice steamed with coconut milk and served with ripe mangoes on top. It's believed 
                         to have originated in the central region of Thailand and is commonly served as a snack or dessert.</p>

        <h2>Cooking Methods</h2>

            <h3>Preparing and Soaking the Sticky Rice</h3>
                <li>Wash the rice 3-4 times to remove the starch or until the water is almost clear.
                Leave to soak overnight for at least 8-24 hours. Afterwards, drain the water from the rice.</li>

            <h3>Steaming the Rice</h3>
                <li>Place the rice on a bamboo basket or any steamed lined with parchment paper.
                Steam for 20-25 minutes or until the rice is cooked and still chewy.</li>
                    
            <h3>Cooking the Sticky Rice</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large pan, heat the coconut milk over medium high heat. Add in the sugar and salt.
                         Leave the coconut milk to simmer over medium high heat until in boils.</li>
                    <li> Once it boils, lower heat to medium and continue stirring until the sugar has dissolved.</li>
                    <li> Add in the steamed rice and cooked down the rich until it has absorbed the coconut milk and 
                         has thickened, around 4 minutes.</li>
                    <li> Turn off the heat and leave to cool for 5 minutes. </li>
                </ol>
            
            <h3>Coconut Sauce</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In the same pan over medium high heat, add the coconut milk and sugar.</li>
                    <li>Stir in the same direction and cook over medium heat until it boils.</li>
                    <li>Once it boils, lower the heat to medium. Dilute the cornstarch with the water.</li>
                    <li>While stirring the coconut milk, pour in the cornstarch mixture.</li>
                    <li>Turn off heat and keep stirring until it thickens.</li>
                    <li>Transfer to a sauce pourer or small container until ready to use.</li>
                </ol>

            <h3>Assembling your Mango Sticky Rice</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Peel the mangoes and slice, creating 4 mango halves (or ‘cheeks’ as I’d like to call them). 
                        Then slice each cheek into 1⁄4 -inch thick strips.</li>
                    <li>Portion the rice and mangoes into 4, then top with toasted sesame seeds. Finish off by drizzling on 
                        some of the coconut sauce. These are best enjoyed when freshly made!</li>
                </ol>
